I know flask well enough to build a good service on. I think that the first iteration is going to be a flask monolith, with the end goal of migrating to micro-services built mostly with golang and asynchronous python libraries. 

### Goals 
- [ ] Product models
- [ ] Warehouse management
- [ ] Order keying


I think that these are sufficient to start. They will build a relatively simple service and can be expanded and adapted in the future.
